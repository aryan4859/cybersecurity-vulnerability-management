## What is Vulnerability Management and Scanning?

- Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting on security vulnerabilities in systems and the software that runs on them. This, implemented alongside with other security tactics, is vital for organizations to prioritize possible threats and minimizing their "attack surface."

- Security vulnerabilities, in turn, refer to technological weaknesses that allow attackers to compromise a product and the information it holds. This process needs to be performed continuously in order to keep up with new systems being added to networks, changes that are made to systems, and the discovery of new vulnerabilities over time.

## Vulnerability management Process

## Vulnerability Management Framework
A vulnerability scanner automates the vulnerability process, typically breaking it down into the following four steps. It’s important to note that a good vulnerability management process should continually scan for vulnerabilities as they are introduced into the environment, as circumstances can quickly change.

### 1)  Identifying vulnerabilities 
> The first and most essential step in any vulnerability management process, of course, is to bring to light all of the vulnerabilities that may exist across your environment. A vulnerability scanner goes about this by scanning the full range of accessible systems that exist—from laptops, desktops, and servers on to databases, firewalls, switches, printers, and beyond.

From there, the vulnerability scanner identifies any open ports and services that are running on those systems, logging in to those systems and gathering detailed information where possible before correlating the information it obtains with known vulnerabilities. This insight can be used to create reports, metrics, and dashboards for a variety of audiences.

### 2) 

Once you’ve identified all the vulnerabilities across your environment, you’ll need to evaluate them in order to appropriately deal with the risks they pose according to your organization’s risk management strategy. Different vulnerability management solutions use different risk ratings and scores for vulnerabilities, but one commonly referenced framework for new programs is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Vulnerability scores can help organizations determine how to prioritize the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered, it’s important to also consider other factors to form a complete understanding of the true risk posed by any given vulnerability. It’s also worth noting that vulnerability scanners can generate false positives in rare instances, thus underscoring the necessity of including other considerations in addition to risk scores at this stage of the process.
